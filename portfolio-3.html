                    </div>
                    <p class="text-justify"> The team made some alterations to the orginal design to improve the manufacturability.</p> 
                    <ul> 
                            <li> WAFFLE TO SUGAR: The switch prevented the plastic from injecting to a point which would cause cooling problems.  Also, flat base allowed for the toy to stand.</li>
                            <li> NO ARMS: Thin arms would have caused cooling problems to the cone piece. Therefore, the team removed the arms to simplify the design.</li> 
                            <li> TOP FACE: To prevent undercuts in the design, the team decided to move the smiley face to the top of the ice cream piece.</li>
                        </ul>
                     <p class="text-justify"> The team split to focus on the core and cavity molds for the ice cream and cone molds.  My focus was the cone's core mold. </p>

                        <h3>Manufacturing Operations: Cone Core Mold</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-justify"> For the cone mold, the team split the design to two symmetric halves with the parting line along the inner edge of the cone.  The cone would be molded horizontally based on the machine's tonnage and clampin force calculations.</p>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> WEDGE VS PINS: The initial design had the two cone halves assembled via small interference slots. However, the molds would not fit together because the tools were not small enough to machine the slots perfectly. The team switched assembly thorugh a pin and hole with ⅛” metal pins.</li>
                            <li> SHRINKAGE: Due to the symmetric design, the cone pieces did not have shrinkage assembly problems. Between the ice cream and cone pices, the ice cream piece could be filed down if there were shrinkcage problems.</li> 
                            <li> SINK MARKS: The pins were located because of the large chunk of material in relation to the constant six hundredths thickness throughout the rest of the part. however, we did not have time to create another iteration to fix this problem.</li>
                        </ul>
                     <p class="text-justify"> For the wound kit, I led the team in brainstorming the packaging design for the wound kit to clearly and effectively instruct a civilian in high stress situatinos. Key design features are: </p>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> TOO MANY TOOLS: As this process initially required the use of seven tools, the long set up time required the team to make another reservation to redo the part. The team learned the tradeoffs between precision of the design vs. manufacturing time.</li>
                            <li> ZEROING PRECISION:  Due to the time constraints mentioned above, the team had trouble rezeroing the tools to exactly the same z position from before. This issue resulted in machining parts of the mold too deeply and ruining the mold.</li> 
                            <li> SHUT OFF: The initial design had an opening at the top of each cone, which caused a shut off. The tight tolerances required in this feature were not met. To fix this, the team decided to do away with the shut off and have the top of the cones closed.</li>
                        </ul>
